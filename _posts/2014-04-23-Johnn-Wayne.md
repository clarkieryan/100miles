#I can also impersonate John Wayne really well….
 
So I thought I’d kick off my blog firstly on a positive note..... I can still ride a bike. YAY!!!!! (I often had doubt since I’ve not placed my bum on the seat for a few years now…), but the downside being, it was painful!! Not only have I discovered muscles that I never thought existed…I can also impersonate John Wayne really well….(hmm definitely investing in some padded shorts!!). So Sunday morning came and myself, Meeky, Leigh and Laura arrived at the scout hut (oh and can’t forget Andy who’s helping on the support team), the sun was shining…it was a fresh day and no one but Leigh was raring to go….my legs ached and I’d only ridden ½ mile to the scout hut!! This was not looking good. After a quick maintenance check on our bikes, Meeky’s was doomed. L The bearings had broken! He had a lucky escape and just tootled off in his car to get them sorted...I waved him off, feeling slightly suspicious, VERY envious and had a look of desperation for him to hide me in the back of the car! No such luck!

So the cycle began….We didn’t have a route we just decided to see where our legs would take us and take it in turns to lead. So through Bedworth, out towards Bulkington, then straight into Nuneaton town Centre through Whitestone and Attleborough. Our pace wasn’t brilliant but we didn’t stop, we just kept going. The burning sensation in my thighs was wearing away and I started to actually enjoy cycling….UNTIL the weather turned, with rain and what felt like gale force wind attacking us I just wanted to be tucked up in bed and having a Sunday lie in!! Against the elements we powered through for just over 10 miles, and I only stopped to walk up what felt like a giant mountain… suddenly then it hit me…100 miles in 3 days….THIS IS GOING TO BE HARD!!
 
But now I’ve started it can only get easier right???
