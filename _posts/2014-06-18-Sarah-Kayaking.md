I must admit,  I was not looking forward to a Sunday morning spent kayaking after a belly full of liquor the night before.  To my surprise the sun was shining and the fresh air was just what I needed. I hadn't been kayaking in quite some time so my arms started to ache after a while but it wasn't too taxing. It was very pleasant to go out as a group and support each other with laughs along the way! We did quite a few miles in an impressive time and nobody found it too challenging (apart from when some very protective swans were in the way).
