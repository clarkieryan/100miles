#We are practically there now! 

So it's a week to go until we start the challenge, many of the team were out attempting a half marathon in the hills of Cheltenham! Personally I am over the moon with my time of 2 hours 55 minutes, which beats my personal best by a huge time difference! Doing the training I have, has drastically improved my overall fitness which is great. Before I would struggle to jog 20 yards and now I can happily do 3/4 km (on the flat). Overall I'm really glad I have taken on this challenge as it' not only raising money for two great causes, but it's allowed me to really progress my own fitness!

Being at uni until recently, I haven't been able to take part in any of the activity sessions the team have been doing however now I'm back I can. And I can honestly say they are some of the funniest nights I have taken part in, I don't think I will need to do much paddling with Leigh's power strokes! 

Really looking forward to it now, lets do this thing!
