![ Why?](/img/header/default-logo.png)

Why would I agree to walking cycling and kayaking 100 miles with a group of people half my age? There are several reasons for me to agree to this.

Firstly it’s to celebrate 1st Bedworth’s 100 years of scouting. A very worthy cause and the money we raise will benefit all our scouts.

Secondly the guys I’m attempting this with are amongst the most genuine, consensuses and selfless people I have ever known. I’m very proud to be part of the challenge group, and scouting in general.

Thirdly After a couple of years of ill health it’s a personal challenge to show myself, my family and my friends that I’m stronger and feeling good to be alive.
