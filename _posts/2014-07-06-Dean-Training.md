title: Where are we now?
excerpt: S wouldn’t consider myself to be one on the greatest fitness people in the world, but so far I have been really enjoying the training we’ve done. And I never thought I would be using the words training and enjoying in the same sentence. For a start I seem to be able to do a lot more than I thought I could. Which is probably just as well seeing as I’ve got to do 100 miles.

#Where are we now?
I wouldn’t consider myself to be one on the greatest fitness people in the world, but so far I have been really enjoying the training we’ve done. And I never thought I would be using the words training and enjoying in the same sentence. For a start I seem to be able to do a lot more than I thought I could. Which is probably just as well seeing as I’ve got to do 100 miles. We’ve had some good fun and loads of laughs as well. Watching Ryan trying to keep up with Cannons power paddle strokes in the canoe is pretty good entertainment. If we have as much fun with as many laughs doing the 100 miles then its gonna be a great three days.... provided I don’t need a defibrillator at the end of it all.
